A standard git workflow is as follows 

-pull github code onto your local machine to have most up-to-date files
-create a new branch when begining work on a new feature
-write code and make changes 
-push branch to the github repository
-submit a pull request on github (this is a request to merge the branches; this is not the same as using pull to update local files) 


workflow from jared:
Here is the full work flow
git pull
git checkout -b  (branch name)
Do the work you want to do when done 
    git add . (edited)
    git commit -m "(your commit message here)"
    git fetch all
    git rebase origin-main
fix merge conflicts if they exist; once you fix merge conflicts 
    git rebase --continue
    git push

If you can't fix merge conflicts or are unsure 

git rebase --abort
and wait till we can meet to discuss
