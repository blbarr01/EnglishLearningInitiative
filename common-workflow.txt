A standard git workflow is as follows 

-pull github code onto your local machine to have most up-to-date files
-create a new branch when begining work on a new feature
-write code and make changes 
-push branch to the github repository
-submit a pull request on github (this is a request to merge the branches; this is not the same as using pull to update local files)
